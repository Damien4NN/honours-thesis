This is my cognitive science honours thesis. 

Title
-----
The Theory of Active Inference, the Free-Energy Principle and Affective Phenomena. 

Abstract
--------
To achieve completeness, cognitive (or mind) architectures must integrate emotions—a dimension
of the mind that has historically resisted formalization. Active inference and the
free energy principle offer a unified, neurologically and mathematically grounded theory of
the mind and the brain, presenting a promising framework for addressing the complexity
of emotions. This honours thesis begins by providing a conceptual and mathematical introduction
to the fundamentals of active inference and the free energy principle, including
derivations of the three key free energy equations. It then explores affective phenomena as
characterized by the Human Affectome project, before analyzing how they can be understood
as manifestations of the free-energy minimization process. It proposes that affects may be
the subjective experience of free energy variation within the brain. Finally, the thesis examines
the interaction between cognition and emotion, suggesting that cognition may serve to
reduce the brain’s rate of false positives, thereby optimizing the its predictions.
